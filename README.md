Parking Lot — Low Level Design (Java)

A multi-level parking lot management system designed using object-oriented
design principles and classic design patterns. Built as part of LLD interview
preparation (SDE-2/SDE-3 level).

Problem Statement

Design a parking lot system that:


Supports multiple vehicle types (Car, Bike, Truck)
Supports multiple parking spot types (Compact, Large, Motorcycle, Handicapped)
Spans multiple levels/floors
Allocates the correct spot type to each vehicle on entry
Issues a ticket on entry and calculates a fee on exit based on duration and vehicle type
Is easily extensible to new vehicle types, spot types, and pricing rules


Design Patterns Used

Core Entities


ParkingLot — Singleton entry point; owns levels, active tickets, and pricing strategies
Level — A floor containing a list of ParkingSpots
ParkingSpot — A single spot with a type (SpotType) and status (FREE/OCCUPIED)
Vehicle (abstract) — Car, Bike, Truck
Ticket — Created on entry, tracks entry/exit time and the assigned spot
PricingStrategy — One implementation per vehicle type, calculates fee from parked duration



Known Design Trade-off (intentional, documented for discussion)

The initial DefaultAllocationStrategy used a switch on VehicleType to
resolve the required SpotType, which violates the Open/Closed Principle —
adding a new vehicle type (e.g. ElectricCar) requires modifying that switch.

A cleaner alternative: let each Vehicle subclass expose its own
getRequiredSpotType(), so adding a new vehicle type requires zero
modification to existing classes — only a new subclass. This trade-off is
called out deliberately to demonstrate the kind of OCP analysis expected at
SDE-3 level interviews.
